                <h2>Implemented</h2>
                <p><h4>Colour:</h4> The soft colours chosen help the site to be readable during the day and night without straining the eyes.</p>
                <p><h4>Fixed Header/Navigation Bar:</h4> In the default stylesheet the Header and Navigation bar are fixed, so this would help the user to have the ability to move through the site quickly. Also this helps to utilize more of the width of the website to show more content horizontally.</p>
                <p><h4>Projection Style:</h4> This stylesheet helps to display more content and with bigger font size for projectors. The Header and Navigation bar are reduced in size and not fixed, since it will allow to show more content.</p>
                <p><h4>Printer Style:</h4> It removes all the colours and unneeded elements like header, navigation bars and reduces blank spaces in order to waste less ink.</p>
                <p><h4>Horizontal Menu:</h4> Having all the pages in an horizontal design, allows more space for the content to be shown horizontally. Also, if the window is compressed the menu will adapt in several rows.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Pending</h2>
                <p><h4>Mobile Style:</h4> For the students that would like to read before the class or study for the quizzes, it would be helpful to have the contect adapted to small or medium screens in landscape or portrait mode.</p>
                <p><h4>Submenus:</h4> In order to allow more links in the menu would be perfect to include the submenus functionality, this would show another row with more links, and hide the siblings on the previous link selected.</p>
