                <ul><li><h4>Proto-Site</h4> There are four sample pages: Home, About the Course, Lecture 3, and Lecture 10. All of them were redesigned from <a href="http://bcitcomp.ca/1950/">COMP 1950</a>.</li>
                <li><h4>Site Map</h4> Site map provides overall structure of the website.</li>
                <li><h4>Rationale</h4> This page thoroughly describes about the project.</li></ul></p>
                <p>Marcos has worked on general structure of the website as well as the header and navigation section by using server side scripting. He also provided Rationale and a stylesheet for print media. Bo Ra completed the site map and the overall styles for the main section of the project. She provided a stylesheet for projectors and the script on Introduction page.
